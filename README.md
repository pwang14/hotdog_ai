# hotdog_ai

Project uses TensorFlow library through Keras API. Uses deep learning to classify images of hotdogs and not hotdogs. Convolutional neural net trained with ~85% accuracy.

Currently this is a very small project to familiarize myself with Tensorflow. With more experimenting and training techniques, I hope to increase the accuracy of the network.
I also want to improve the functionality of the web app, and make the front end look nicer.

The data was retrieved from Kaggle.
